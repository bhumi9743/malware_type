Malware : Malware is one type of malicious software or malicious file.
Type of malware 
1. Adware : Adware, as the name indicates, is malware that involves advertising. Also known as advertising-supported software, adware displays unwanted advertisements on your computer, sometimes in the form of pop-up ads, that track users’ browsing activity.

2. Fileless malware : Fileless malware is a type of malware that uses software, applications, and protocols already built-in or native to device operating systems to install and execute malicious activities. In other words, no files are needed to download this type of malware, hence the name fileless malware.  Fileless malware is memory-based, not file-based. 

3. Viruses : Viruses are a type of malware that often take the form of a piece of code inserted in an application, program, or system and they’re deployed by victims themselves.

4. Worms : Worms, similar to malware viruses, are a type of malware that replicates itself. Unlike viruses, however, worm malware can copy itself without any human interaction, and it’s not host-dependent, meaning it does not need to attach itself to a software program to cause damage.

5. Trojans : Trojans are a type of malware disguised as bona fide software, applications, or files to deceive users into downloading it and, unknowingly, granting control of their devices. Once installed, a trojan can perform the action it was designed for, be it to damage, disrupt, steal, or inflict some other harmful action on your data or network. 

6. Bots : Bots are normally used to automate certain tasks, meaning they can run without specific instructions from humans. An organization or individual can use a bot to replace a repetitive task that a human would otherwise have to perform. Bots are also much faster at these tasks than humans.

7. Ransomware : Ransomware is malware that employs encryption to hold a victim's information at ransom. A user or organization's critical data is encrypted so that they cannot access files, databases, or applications. A ransom is then demanded to provide access.

8. Spyware : Spyware is a type of malware that infiltrates devices without the owner’s knowledge. This is often for the purpose of spying on internet activity, tracking log in and password information, or collecting sensitive information that can be used for fraudulent purposes. 

9. keylogger : Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers you type, the webpages you visit – all by logging your keyboard strokes. The software is installed on your computer, and records everything you type.

10.Rootkit : Rootkits are a type of malware that grants cybercriminals remote control of victims’ devices, oftentimes without the victims’ knowledge. Since rootkits are designed to remain hidden, they can hijack or subvert security software, making it likely that this type of malware could live on your computer for a long time causing significant damage. 

11.crypto-malware : Crypto-malware is a form of malware that enables a threat actor to carry out cryptojacking activity. While the process used by hackers is essentially the same as compared to that used by legitimate cryptominers, crypto-malware leverages another user's devices and processing power to gain payment.

12.logic bombs : A logic bomb is a malicious program that is triggered when a logical condition is met, such as after a number of transactions have been processed, or on a specific date (also called a time bomb). Malware such as worms often contain logic bombs, behaving in one manner, then changing tactics on a specific date and time.
